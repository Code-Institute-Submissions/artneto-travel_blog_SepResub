# What a Trip|Blog  Milestone Django Project. 




What a Trip is a contemporary vision of a user who has decided to travel  all over the world and is interested in sharing tips and experiences with some other travellers.

## Objective
My 4th Milestone project is an E-commerce Django project. This project shows the knowledge I acquired during the course. The skills learned in the modules that led to this project, include HTML Fundamentals, CSS Fundamentals, JavaScript, Interactive Frontend Development, Python, Data-Centric Development, User-Centric Development, and Django. Adding Django to my skill set; I developed a blog that allows the user to interact with an efficient website.

Check out App Deployed on Heroku [here](https://blogtravel-django.herokuapp.com/)



## UI/UX
## Project goals

The website's user interface (UX) was designed with simplicity in mind. The app is fully functional on all screen sizes, including 1400px, 1200px, 992px, 768px, and 576px, with comprehensive examination for each functionality.


The goal of this assignment is to create a web interface that allows users to simply store and access and performance the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) actions. This project's goal is to allow users to create, store, modify, and remove posts (CRUD). People that are interested in topics such as travel or planning to live abroad are the target audience for this initiative. Users can create new categories, which greatly expands the reach of the blog's conversation topics.


### User Stories:
As a user, I want:
*	Be able to launch the site on my preferred device (mobile, tablet, desktop).
*	Be able to view posts and comments created by other users without creating an account.
*	Be able to read selected blog posts. 
*	Be able to select category according to my interest.
*	Be able to create a user account.
*	Be able create user profile and bio. 
*	Be able to create a new category.
*	Be able to upload my picture and media.

### Features

#	Navbar:
The navigation bar is at the top, with a logo that functions as a button and takes the user to the homepage.Navabar provides an option to register for new users, as well as the ability to login for those who already have an account. This blog's accessible social networks are listed on the right side of the navbar.

The navbar will display the functionality to create a post and add a category after the access has been created (if the user still doesn't have an account) and logged in.

![](static/img/navbar2.PNG)

The user will have accessibility to a dropdown menu that contains Account preferences, Profile Page, Edit Profile, and Logout.

## Testing 

 # Creating an Account
  I've made my own personal account in addition to the master Admin account. In addition to these two primary accounts, I tested with about ten additional accounts to ensure that authentication and validation worked as expected.


 #  Add  Post | Edit | Delete 
  In addition to my personal posts, I created 11 test posts, primarily to test the pagination option at the bottom of the page. My Admin account and the testing accounts were used.
  Once the post has been created, the responsible user of this post will be able to edit or delete it.
  However, for authentication and security reasons, the logged in user will be unable to delete or edit other users' posts.
  As part of a test, I deleted some posts, and everything worked perfectly.


 #  Profile
  - New user, you will view three options on their account dropdown.

  ![](static/img/createcc.PNG)
 
 -  User with created profile can view your own Bio and can have access to your social media. 

  ![](static/img/profilepage.PNG)

 # Account Settings:

  1.	I was able to edit all the information detailed above and  able to login in. 
  
  # Create Profile:
  I was able to create my account and add a profile picture, however, iv profile picture is not added a default picture will be displayed. 
  
  # Logout:
  I was able to logout without creating a profile.

## Validators

  # HTML

  W3C HTML Validator - Unfortunately, the W3C Validator for HTML does not understand the syntax of Jinja templates, so it generates numerous errors regarding {{ variables }}, {% for %} {% endfor %}, and so on. Apart from the Jinja warnings and errors, all of the remaining code validates flawlessly.

  # CSS

  W3C CSS Validator - I am using :root{} variables in my CSS, which isn't validated by the validator This is causing a large number of parsing errors, which are not errors and work perfectly fine.

  # Javascript

  Javascript was used for pagination and about warning forms. No errors were found on the Javascript code.


  # PEP8 Online

  memebers_signup and world app all the .py files passed the validation.

# Issues Encountered

- I had some difficulties in finding the correct media query resolutions for my page, but in the end I managed to make the content adapt to each different screen.
Outcome

- I have found a bug:" migrate says a column that does not exist does not exist and recommends renaming it", for solution, I have updated the database schema outside a migration.

- I was able to construct my first website using all of the material supplied during the course and with the aid of my mentor. I am pleased with the outcome.

- Thanks again to the entire support team and a big hug to Christina, Oisin and Sean who have always been patient and showing a great people skills.


# Resubmission Remarks 
After review by the evaluation team, below is a list of what was fixed in this project.

- Missing UX and/or navigation issues
- Template code results in various HTML errors.

Solution with the suggestion of the assets team I made sure to use the URL validator for each page and form on my site, being possible to: fix errors of classes that were open and it was also possible to fix the layout and background that was making some forms disheveled.


- No indication of sub-optimal implementation of user acceptance criteria in user stories.
- No indication or sub-optimal implementation of prioritized user stories within the agile tool.

Solution: I revised the module for Agile and the importance of this tool and as a result the implementation is visible in the Travel Blog dashboard under Projects as "done".

- Does not allow users to initiate actions based on their choice or allows broken functionality.

Solution: Create a comment section there was an error in the python logic and it was fixed, now the user can create a comment.

- Env.py file is present on Github.

Solution: This file was mistaken with that even when DEBUG only in false it was presented.
With the help of the tutors, it was possible to identify the error and the solution was to create a new repo environment for my project and reset all the keys that were in the env.py.
